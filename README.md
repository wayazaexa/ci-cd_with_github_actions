# ESP-IDF Project Template with CI, Wokwi Simulation, and Hardware Testing

This is a template project to be used as a reference for ESP-IDF projects with GitHub CI.

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-esp-test-template/actions/workflows/ci_workflow.yml/badge.svg)

The purpose of this project is to provide a good **starting point for customers who are developing an application based on Espressif chips and want to run unit or integration tests both in simulation and on real hardware.**

*You can fork and update this project according to your specific needs.*

> Note: As default, the hardware testing job is `disabled`. To enable it, please see the **How to setup (HW)** documents.

## How to setup (Wokwi simulation)

Go to the [Wokwi CI Dashboard](https://wokwi.com/ci/dashboard) and create a new CI token. Then add the token to your GitHub repository secrets as `WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN` (under "Settings" -> "Secrets and Variables" -> "Actions" -> "Repository secrets").

You can also run the tests locally. For more information, please refer to the [Wokwi CI documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/wokwi-ci/getting-started).
